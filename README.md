# BlockX

**Enterprise Financial Infrastructure Platform built in Rust**

BlockX is a next-generation financial infrastructure and security platform designed for institutions, fintechs, payment providers, and digital asset ecosystems.

The platform is being built from the ground up with a **deterministic core**, emphasizing:

- Security by Design
- Auditability
- Compliance Readiness
- Scalability
- Modular Services
- Cloud-Native Architecture
- High Performance with Rust

---

# Vision

BlockX aims to provide the foundational infrastructure required for:

- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Authentication and Authorization
- Digital Wallets
- KYC / KYB
- Financial Ledger
- Payment Gateway Infrastructure
- Risk Management
- Audit and Compliance
- Tokenization of Digital and Real-World Assets (RWA)

The architecture separates deterministic business logic from future intelligent orchestration layers, ensuring predictability, security, and auditability.

---

# Architecture Principles

BlockX follows enterprise engineering principles:

### Security First

Security is treated as a core feature.

### Deterministic Core

Business rules must remain predictable, auditable, and reproducible.

### Auditability

Critical operations must be traceable.

### Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)

Each service evolves independently.

### Clean Architecture

Application, Domain, Infrastructure, and Interface layers are separated.

### Domain Driven Design (DDD)

Business domains are isolated and modeled independently.

### BPMN Ready

Future business workflows will be modeled using BPMN, especially for:

- Onboarding
- KYC
- Risk Analysis
- Payments
- Compliance
- Tokenization

# Current Development Status

## Sprint 0 — Foundation ✅

- Monorepo Structure
- Cargo Workspace
- Shared Crates
- Environment Configuration
- Error Handling
- Observability Foundation

---

## Sprint 1 — Platform Foundation ✅

### Crates

#### Config

Application configuration.

#### Shared

Common utilities.

#### Errors

Centralized error handling.

#### Observability

Logging, tracing and audit foundation.

---

## Sprint 2 — Auth Service 🚀

### Implemented

✅ User Domain Model

✅ User Creation

✅ Email Validation

✅ Password Validation

✅ Argon2id Password Hashing

✅ Password Verification

✅ Login Flow

✅ JWT Token Generation

✅ JWT Token Validation

✅ Duplicate User Protection

✅ User Repository

✅ Find User By Email

✅ Exists User

✅ Configuration through Config crate

✅ Bootstrap Integration

✅ Unit Tests

---

# Authentication Features

## User Creation

Users are created through the application layer.

Features:

- Unique ID generation
- Email validation
- Password validation
- Password hashing
- Duplicate email protection

---

## Password Security

BlockX currently uses:

### Argon2id

Passwords are never stored in plain text.

Example:

```text
$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$...
```

Features:

- Random Salt
- Memory Hard
- GPU Resistant
- OWASP Recommended

---

## JWT Authentication

Current implementation:

### Access Token

Features:

- User Identification
- Issued At (iat)
- Expiration Time (exp)
- Signature Validation

### Validation

Implemented:

- Token Decoding
- Signature Verification
- Invalid Token Rejection

---

# Current Repository Pattern

```rust
pub trait UserRepository {

    fn save(
        &self,
        user: &User,
    );

    fn find_by_email(
        &self,
        email: &str,
    ) -> Option<User>;

    fn exists(
        &self,
        email: &str,
    ) -> bool;
}
```

Current implementation:

```text
InMemoryUserRepository
```

Planned:

```text
PostgreSQLUserRepository
```
